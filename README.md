# SacCityBudget
## Hacking the Sacramento City Budget

This is an exploratory project to visualize data from the City of Sacramento's 2015-16 budget using R and Shiny. It currently uses data from the _proposed_ 2015-16 budget, downloaded from [data.cityofsacramento.org](http://data.cityofsacramento.org/home/) in late June 2015. It will be updated with _adopted_ budget info once that data is posted.

All you need to run the dashboard in its current state is:
* [R](http://www.r-project.org/)
* [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/)
* The Shiny, Shiny Dashboard, and DT packages for R
* ui.R, server.R, and helpers.R from this repository

Current version is up and running at http://explorer.openbudgetsac.org/
