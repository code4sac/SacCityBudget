## Hacking the Sacramento City Budget

This is a project to visualize data from the City of Sacramento's Fiscal Year 2018 budget using R and Shiny. It uses data downloaded from [data.cityofsacramento.org](http://data.cityofsacramento.org/home/).

All you need to run the dashboard in its current state is:
* [R](http://www.r-project.org/)
* [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/)
* The Shiny, Shiny Dashboard, and DT packages for R
* NewAppTotal.R, and helpers2.R from this repository

Current version is up and running at http://explorer.openbudgetsac.org/
